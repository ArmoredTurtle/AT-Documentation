# GUI support

## Mainsail
AFC integrates with [mainsail](https://www.mainsail.xyz), currently via [an open-source fork](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/mainsail-AFC/). As shown below, it can integrate with multiple units including different types (in this case, BoxTurtle and [HTLF](https://www.printables.com/model/1249234-happyturtlelettucefeeder-htlf-by-armoredturtle-an)).

## KlipperScreen
A KlipperScreen integration is available, which allows you to control AFC features directly from the KlipperScreen interface. This includes loading and unloading filament, as well as monitoring the status of the AFC system.

For more information, please refer to the [AFC KlipperScreen GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Screen-Add-On)
