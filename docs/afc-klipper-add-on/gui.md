# GUI support

## Mainsail
AFC integrates with [mainsail](https://www.mainsail.xyz), currently via [an open-source fork](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/mainsail-AFC/). As shown below, it can integrate with multiple units including different types (in this case, BoxTurtle and [HTLF](https://www.printables.com/model/1249234-happyturtlelettucefeeder-htlf-by-armoredturtle-an)).
